  *In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.
  *It is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method)”.


For Example: 
   
   Car,Pen,Bike,Compuetr,Person.
   Singel value Object var car = "BMW";




2.Syntax:
  
   var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};
Ex:
  var car = {Make: “HYUNDAI”, Model: “i10”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”,Mileage: “8Kmpl”};

  * key called property
  * value called property value.
  *The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.
  *Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.


The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
 
 *ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;   EX://car.Model = i10;


The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:
 
 *delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;          EX: // delete car.color.white;


The syntax to access a property from an object is:

 *objectName.property        // Car.Make




3.Object Methods:

 *An object method is an object property containing a function definition.
  \\Ex:Let’s assume to start the car there will be a mechanical functionality.

function(){return ignition.on}
and so similar is to stop/brake/headlights on & off, etc.
